    <h1>What is the Deep and Dark Web?</h1>

    <h2>Dark web definition</h2>
    
    <div>The dark web is the hidden collective of internet sites only accessible by a specialized web browser. It is used for keeping internet activity anonymous and private, which can be helpful in both legal and illegal applications. While some use it to evade government censorship, it has also been known to be utilized for highly illegal activity.</div>

    <h2>What is the dark web, deep web, and surface web?</h2>

    <div>The Internet is sizable with millions of web pages, databases, and servers all run 24 hours a day. But the so-called "visible" Internet (aka surface web or open web) — sites that can be found using search engines like Google and Yahoo — is just the tip of the iceberg.

        There are several terms surrounding the non-visible Web, but it's worth knowing how they differ if you're planning to browse off the beaten path.</div>

        <h3>The surface web or open web</h3>

        <div>The open web, or surface web, is the “visible” surface layer. If we continue to visualize the entire web like an iceberg, the open web would be the top portion that’s above the water. From a statistical standpoint, this collective of websites and data makes up under 5% of the total internet.

            All commonly public-facing websites accessed via traditional browsers like Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox are contained here. Websites are usually labeled with registry operators like “.com” and “.org” and can be easily located with popular search engines.
            
            Locating surface web websites is possible because search engines can index the web via visible links (a process called “crawling” due to the search engine traveling the web like a spider).</div>

            <h3>The deep web</h3>

            <div>The deep web rests below the surface and accounts for approximately 90% of all websites. This would be the part of an iceberg beneath the water, much larger than the surface web. In fact, this hidden web is so large that it's impossible to discover exactly how many pages or websites are active at any one time.

                Carrying on with the analogy, big search engines could be considered like fishing boats that can only "catch" websites close to the surface. Everything else, from academic journals to private databases and more illicit content, is out of reach. This deep web also includes the portion that we know as the dark web.
                
                While many news outlets use "deep web" and "dark web" interchangeably, much of the deep portion as a whole is perfectly legal and safe. Some of the largest parts of the deep web include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>database :</strong> both public and privately protected file collections that are not connected to other areas of the web, only to be searched within the database itself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intranets :</strong> internal networks for enterprises, governments, and educational facilities used to communicate and control aspects privately within their organizations.</li>
                            </ul> </div>
